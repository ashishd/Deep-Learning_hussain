This allows for quickly and easily checking if a neural network will get your problems solved. In addition you can build any architecture you can imagine, from simple networks to more complex ones like auto-encoders, convolutional or recurrent neural networks. Keras models can also be deployed across a wide range of platforms like Android, iOS, web-apps, etc."

In this case, we choose adam as our optimizer and mean squared error as our loss function. Optimizers and loss functions will be covered later on in the course, so don't worry about it for now. Compiling our model produces no output. Our model is now ready to train!\r\n"

As our model is being trained, we will get some output showing the progress. We can see the model is improving since the mean squared error loss is decreasing at each epoch."
