With Keras you can build industry-ready models in no time, with much less code than Theano, as we saw before, and a higher abstraction than that offered by TensorFlow. This allows for quickly and easily checking if a neural network will get your problems solved. In addition you can build any architecture you can imagine, from simple networks to more complex ones like auto-encoders, convolutional or recurrent neural networks. Keras models can also be deployed across a wide range of platforms like Android, iOS, web-apps, etc."

If as you dive into deep learning you find yourself needing to use low-level features, for instance to have a finer control of how your network applies gradients, you could use TensorFlow and tweak whatever you need. Now that you know better what Keras is and why to use it, perhaps we should discuss when and why to use neural networks in the first place."

So it's wise to use neural networks. You will learn about the usefulness of convolutional neural networks later on in the course."
