        "Why use Keras instead of other low-level libraries like TensorFlow? With Keras you can build industry-ready models in no time, with much less code than Theano, as we saw before, and a higher abstraction than that offered by TensorFlow. This allows for quickly and easily checking if a neural network will get your problems solved. In addition you can build any architecture you can imagine, from simple networks to more complex ones like auto-encoders, convolutional or recurrent neural networks. Keras models can also be deployed across a wide range of platforms like Android, iOS, web-apps, etc."

If as you dive into deep learning you find yourself needing to use low-level features, for instance to have a finer control of how your network applies gradients, you could use TensorFlow and tweak whatever you need. Now that you know better what Keras is and why to use it, perhaps we should discuss when and why to use neural networks in the first place."

Previously, it was the domain expert that had to set rules based on experimentation and heuristics to extract the relevant features of data. Neural networks can learn the best features and their combination, they can perform feature engineering themselves. That's why they are so useful. But what is unstructured data?"

For instance, when classifying images of cats and dogs: Images are unstructured data, we don't care as much about why the network knows it's a cat or a dog, and we can benefit from convolutional neural networks. So it's wise to use neural networks. You will learn about the usefulness of convolutional neural networks later on in the course."
